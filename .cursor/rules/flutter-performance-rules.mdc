description: Provides performance-related guidelines for Flutter development, including image caching, list optimization, and memory management.
globs: lib/**/presentation/**/*.{dart,widget.dart}  # Targets presentation/UI layers where performance matters most
---
- Cache images efficiently (e.g., using CachedNetworkImage).
- Optimize list rendering with ListView.builder, Slivers, and proper cacheExtent.
- Avoid unnecessary rebuilds by using const constructors and optimized build methods.
- Follow proper state management patterns to avoid widget tree bloating.
- Dispose controllers and listeners to prevent memory leaks.
- Use platform channels only when needed, and isolate heavy native work.
- Enable and follow Dart/Flutter compiler optimization strategies.
