description: Applies general Flutter best practices across the entire project, focusing on architecture, design, and code quality.
globs: lib/**/*.*
---
- Adapt to the existing architecture while maintaining clean and consistent code.
- Use Flutter 3.x features and Material 3 design system throughout the UI.
- Apply clean architecture principles: separation of presentation, domain, and data layers.
- Use consistent state management (BLoC, Riverpod, or StateNotifier) based on project conventions.
- Use dependency injection via GetIt or Riverpod for modular and testable code.
- Implement robust and predictable error handling across layers (use Either/Result where appropriate).
- Follow platform-specific UI/UX guidelines for Android, iOS, and web.
- Implement localization and internationalization using Flutter's `l10n` tools and ARB files.
