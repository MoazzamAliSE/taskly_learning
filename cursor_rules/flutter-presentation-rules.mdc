globs: lib/features/**/presentation/**/*.{dart,widget.dart,page.dart}
---
- Follow existing architecture and feature boundaries while writing UI code.
- Use Flutter 3.x and Material 3 widgets for modern UI styling and behavior.
- Compose widgets into small, reusable components with a single responsibility.
- Use const constructors wherever possible to improve performance.
- Define widget keys explicitly when needed for list items or animations.
- Use GoRouter for navigation and route-based animations.
- Apply proper form validation with feedback to users.
- Guard against UI crashes using error boundaries or safe fallbacks.
- Ensure accessibility compliance: readable labels, proper contrast, touch targets, and screen reader support.
